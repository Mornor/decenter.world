# Steem concerns

## Value of posts should be few cents for almost all users

Actual value of facebook users are on order of dozens of dollars / year,
so payouts of hundreds of dollars or more per post can't really make sense
economically, even if authors / curators are allowed to capture most value
they create.

## Consensus mechanism may privilege large holders

Why are only 1 / 20 blocks PoW?

PoS tends to centralize wealth in existing owners.

Is this just to be able to call the consensum mechanism
"hybrid PoW / PoS"?

## Uneven distribution of tokens

Initial distribution mechanism was to quickly mine blocks with large
inflation rate [ todo: more details ], leading few people [ 45? ]
controlling > 50% of all Steem Power.

Under Pos / DPoS, existing SP owners will receive more SP both in absolute
numbers and in proportion of all SP.

Inflation was 100% new STEEM per year earlier, but lowered to 9.5%
with 0.5% less per year in 2016:

## Low supply of liquid STEEM causes high prices

Less than 10% of actual STEEM tokens in circulation [ todo: more details ]
are actually traded (the rest locked up in SP), which pushes up price.
